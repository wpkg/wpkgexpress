wpkgExpress is a web-frontend to the wpkg software deployment system.

Requirements
============
 - Apache (for the .htaccess usage)
 - PHP 5.0.2 or newer
 - Any(?) CakePHP 1.2 DataSource (i.e. mysql, mssql, postgres, etc) -- Note: thus far only mysql has been tested

Getting Started
===============
 - Uncompress this archive to a directory on your webserver that is reachable via a browser (Firefox 3.x is recommended for best results).
 - Start the wpkgExpress installation process by navigating to (replacing 'yourserver' with your hostname and 'someplace' with the
   directory containing wpkgExpress): http://yourserver/someplace/installer
 - Follow and complete the short installation wizard and you're set!
